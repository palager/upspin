Rm removes Upspin files and directories from the name space.

The -glob flag can be set to false to have rm skip Glob processing,
treating its arguments as literal text even if they contain special
characters. (Leading @ signs are always expanded.)

Rm does not delete the associated storage, which is rarely necessary
or wise: storage can be shared between items and unused storage is
better recovered by automatic means.

Rm does not delete the targets of links, only the links themselves.

See the deletestorage command for more information about deleting
storage.
